\chapter{Risk Management}\label{cha:riskManagement}
Risk management is about identifying risks and finding solutions to problems before they can occur. The list of risks can be found in table \ref{tab:RiskRegister}. The identified risks will increase as the project moves forward. Especially when a decision is made for the wearable and the process.

In figure \ref{fig:risks} the risks can be seen in a graph that shows their Probability and Impact again. The color emphasizes the amount of attention a risk should get, in order for the project to continue smoothly.

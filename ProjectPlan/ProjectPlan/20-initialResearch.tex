\chapter{Initial Analysis}
The process that has been decided on is the Order Picking W3-5. The available Processes were:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Order Picking High Rack
	\item Order Picking W3-5
	\item Goods Receipt and Put away
\end{itemize}

The other two processes were discarded. Order Picking High Rack has been discarded due to the nature of what should be created. A simulation that should model a real environment. Modelling a High Rack and usage of that would be too hard and would take too much time.

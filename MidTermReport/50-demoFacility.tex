\chapter{Demo Facility}\label{cha:demoFacility}
Physical creation of the demo facility that showcases the possibilities of the chosen wearable in the process of order picking in a warehouse. Most of the contents in this chapter is based on speculation, as it is not yet existing.

\section{Infrastructure}
The infrastructure
\begin{itemize}
	\item Mock Warehouse Management System
	\item Rest API
	\item Wearable not chosen and therefore that part of the communication layer is not described yet.
\end{itemize}
\section{Design}
General Design will be based on the reference model described in chapter \ref{cha:reference}. 
\section{Planning}
Trying multiple wearables out. Choosing a single wearable to use for the process. It is planned to create a demo environment by using one or two racks that can be used to place packages to pick in there. A demo case that consists of picking these packages. A navigation system that divides the room to be able to say a part of the room would be a certain location string. The possibility to reset the case to showcase the test case multiple times without much effort. Possibly multiple wearables when enough time is at hand to showcase the different possibilities.

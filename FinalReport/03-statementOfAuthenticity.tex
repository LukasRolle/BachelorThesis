\chapter*{Statement of authenticity}\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Statement of authenticity}
I hereby solemnly declare for this submitted work, that:

\begin{itemize}
	\item I myself wrote this internship report, without the assistance of any third party,
	\item I did not cut and paste any information (text, figures, diagrams, tables,..) from others without appropriate use of quotation marks and direct reference to their work,
	\item I did not re-word the ideas of others without proper and clear acknowledgement,
	\item I did not make use of ideas or suggestions that originated from others and claim these as my own,
	\item I did not include words from otherâ€™s work without permission.
\end{itemize}

I am fully aware that any violation of the above will be declared fraud and may result in disadvantageous consequences for me (for example withdrawal of study credits and, in case of a repeated violation, withdrawal of complete study units). If fraud can be proved, I will be required to bear the costs of investigation into and sourcing of the original document.

\chapter{Demo Facility}\label{cha:demoFacility}
Physical creation of the demo facility that showcases the possibilities of the chosen wearable in the process of order picking in a warehouse. This chapter will therefore focus on the planned infrastructure, the existing design and what is planned for the demo facility in the future. As the implementation would mostly just be a repetition of what is discussed in the design section, there is no particular focus on the implementation details.

There is also a major difference between the demo facility task that will be explained in this report and the task given in the logwear website. \citep{website:logwear} The task that will be executed here will be creating a demo facility in a physical \gls{sandbox} environment and the task explained in the work package on the logwear homepage is about implementing the improved process, using a wearable, at a pilot company and observing the results.

\section{Infrastructure}
The infrastructure of the demo facility is divided into multiple areas:
\begin{description}
	\item[Mock WMS] \hfill \\
		A mock \gls{wms} that allows to store different orders and edit them to have a more realistic demo. While not all functionality has to be given, the data has to be persistent and easily resettable to allow showcasing a demo case multiple times. The mock \gls{wms} is deployed on an azure server and is using a \gls{mssql} database.
	\item[Rest API] \hfill \\
		A \gls{rest} \gls{api} that is used to connect to the mock \gls{wms} from an outside perspective, in this case from the communication layer, see subsection \ref{subsec:communication}.
	\item[Communication Layer] \hfill \\
		The communication layer will be deployed on a server with a connection to the \gls{db} \gls{api} and a connection to the wearable.
	\item[Wearable] \hfill \\
		The wearable will need to connect to the communication layer and process input and output.
\end{description}

The mock \gls{wms} and the \gls{rest} \gls{api} are insignificant parts of the implementation, therefore not a lot of thought was put into the decision on choosing these technologies was done out of curiosity for these technologies or being the most comfortable with them respectively.

\section{Demo Scenario}\label{sec:demoScenario}
The demo scenario explains the process that will be executed during the demo facility. Therefore describing the actions taken in detail, but ignoring how they will be executed, e.g. with or without a wearable. The original process can be seen in the appendix, figure \ref{fig:orderPickingProcessDiagram}. For the actual scenario used for the demo facility an activity diagram was created, that can be seen in figure \ref{fig:activityDemoScenario}. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[height=\textheight]{images/activityDiagram_demoScenarioNoExceptions}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Activity Diagram Demo Scenario}
	\label{fig:activityDemoScenario}
\end{figure}

The model shows the original process in a simplified form. It also shows a complete work day and not just the process of picking a single parcel. The worker arrives in the morning and scans their worker card, this is done to log in the worker into the system and be able to get the orders that are allocated to that worker. The next thing is to get the order document, this is currently done on paper, but the intent for this is, that in the end this can be displayed on the wearable. The worker can then at first look at the order document and then continues to start working on that order. 

The order is split up into multiple order lines. An order line contains a single article, location, quantity and a number to identify the order line. The worker identifies the location and starts moving to the article location. At the article location the parcel is scanned and afterwards put on the handcart of the worker. This is repeated until the quantity listed in the order line is met. When the quantity of the order line is met, the order line is confirmed, but there are multiple things that might happen during this process:

\begin{description}
	\item[right amount on cart and pallet not empty] \hfill \\
	The process is working as explained above and the order line is confirmed without a problem.
	\item[right amount on cart and pallet empty] \hfill \\
	The pallet is confirmed empty for the \gls{wms}, but otherwise the process is working as explained above and the order line is confirmed.
	\item[too little amount of parcels on cart and pallet empty] \hfill \\
	The pallet is confirmed empty for the \gls{wms}, afterwards a coordinator is contacted to define the following steps, the process as planned is ending at this point and the steps as defined by the coordinator are executed.
\end{description}

When the order line is successfully confirmed the next order line can be worked on, if the current order line was not the last one of the order. When the order line was the last order line the customer wishes can be incorporated. The quantities for the order will then be checked again and afterwards the order is confirmed. The handcart is then moved to the shipping location. When the order is delivered to the shipping location the next order can be started. If this is the end of the working day for the worker, the process ends.


This diagram was created for multiple reasons:

\begin{description}
	\item[Readability] \hfill \\
	The scale of the original process diagram made it hard to process. One goal was to create a more compact diagram. This was realized by designing it with the \gls{uml} 2.5 notation as specified by the \gls{omg}. \citep{manual:umlnotation}
	\item[Purpose] \hfill \\
	The original diagram had a different purpose, it was supposed to model the process of one of the pilot companies in its entirety. The purpose of the activity diagram is to model a demo case, that does not need to show every single detail of the process in the first place.
	\item[Focus point] \hfill \\
	The demo scenario focuses on the general tasks an order picking worker is doing, but is just focussing on the main points for this. The original diagram also includes the connections to the database and also includes tasks outside of the actual order picking.
\end{description}

\section{Design}\label{sec:design}
The general design for the demo facility application is based on the reference model described in chapter \ref{cha:reference}. The more concrete model for the demo facility can be seen in figure \ref{fig:ClassDiagramL1}.

\begin{figure}[t]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/ClassDiagram_Level1}
	\caption{Package Diagram Demo Facility}
	\label{fig:ClassDiagramL1}
\end{figure}
The package diagram displayed is a high level view on the demo facility. The biggest difference to the reference model is the wearable, which in this case uses a \gls{thinclient} to connect to a web application that is doing most of the work for the wearable. The web application then in turn connects to the \gls{wms} and is replacing the communication layer that is existing in the reference model.

The normal lines represent function calls and the dashed lines represents returned information in the diagram. The following sections will go into detail for each of the displayed packages and the demo facility design will be elaborated further.


\subsection{WMS}
The \acrlong{wms} consists of two parts, the database that is going to contain the data for the demo facility and the database connector. This also defines the interface, with which to connect to the \gls{wms}.

\subsubsection{Database}

Figure \ref{fig:LogicalModelWMS} shows the relations and fields in the database. It can be seen that the database just contains a small amount of information, due to being a demo, an actual \gls{wms} would contain a lot more data. The most important item in the model is the order, as that is the key piece, where most relations lead together. An order has a number that is connecting it to one or multiple workers that are working on them. Furthermore an order consists of multiple \texttt{OrderLine}s. An \texttt{OrderLine} is describing the different lines that would appear on an order, that specify the item and the amount for an order. For a warehouse it is also important to add the pallet where to find the item and if the current line is already acknowledged or not. A pallet has a location in the warehouse and how much of an article stored on the pallet is still available in the warehouse. The article corresponds to a name for the article number. Finally an order is ordered by a customer, a customer might have additional wishes for their orders and an address where that customer wants things delivered to.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/LogicalModel_MockWMS}
	\caption{Relational Schema Warehouse Database}
	\label{fig:LogicalModelWMS}
\end{figure}

For an actual warehouse the customers attributes would change completely, as companies might have multiple addresses, therefore that might change for every order of that customer, making it easier to add an address field to the order and not the customer.  Also a customer might want to add additional wishes just to a specific order or dependent on what might be ordered, therefore the additional wishes might also be moved to the order, but for a demo case, that is not executed at a pilot company, the model is sufficient.

\subsubsection{Interface}
The interface, that is exposed by the \gls{wms}, is a \gls{rest} interface. The options available through the \gls{rest} interface are the following:
\begin{description}
	\item[GET] 
	\begin{description}
		\item[Order] \hfill \\
	Returns the order with the id that is given as an argument. Takes an ID as an argument.
		\item[NextOrder] \hfill \\
	Returns the order with the smallest number for a specific worker. Takes an ID as an argument.
	\end{description}
	\item[POST]
	\begin{description}
		\item[ConfirmOrderLine] \hfill \\
	Confirms that an order line in an order has successfully been picked. Takes an order ID and an orderline ID as arguments.
		\item[ConfirmOrder] \hfill \\
	Confirms that a complete order has been picked. Takes an ID as an Argument.
	\end{description}
	\item[PUT]
	\begin{description}
			\item[ResetDatabse] \hfill \\
	A function that exists purely to have an existing and repeatable demo case. This resets the database to a state it was in at the beginning, before the demo was executed. Takes no arguments.
	\end{description}
\end{description}

\subsection{Wearable}
The wearable is implemented with a \gls{thinclient}. This has multiple advantages, especially for such a demo case where potentially multiple wearables are supposed to be tested. One advantage is, because wearables tend to be less powerful devices just due to their size, the \gls{thinclient} allows to ease the load that would normally be computed on the wearable. But the bigger advantage is, that this allows to employ multiple wearables more easily. A \gls{thinclient} is implemented faster and easier than a \gls{fatclient}, therefore multiple demos for multiple wearables are more easily implemented. This allows to deploy multiple demos a lot easier. At the same time this allows a company a smoother upgrade process, meaning if they ever want to replace their existing wearables to another set of wearables, the transition could be realized a lot cheaper and faster.

Therefore apart from the usage of the input and output information to get information from the user and return information to the user only a communication interface is used to 

\subsection{Web Application}
The web application is split into multiple web pages that leads a worker through the day. The first window shown is a page, where the worker is prompted to log in by scanning their worker id. Then the next order for that worker can be started. Then order lines are displayed in more detail and can be confirmed. If every order line is confirmed the order can be confirmed and the next order can be started. The mockups for these web pages can be found in the appendix in section \ref{sec:webappmockups}.

From a technical perspective, the web application will be implemented using Java and the \gls{jsf} framework. \gls{jsf} is a part of the \gls{jee} platform and is the current standard to implement web applications with Java. Furthermore \gls{jsf} is a framework that is using the \gls{mvc} pattern to deploy web applications. 

This was chosen as the framework to implement the web application due to familiarity with the technology and it being a framework that allows rather easily to implement multiple web pages and connect that to a controller in the back end.

\section{Implementation}
This section will not discuss everything that is a part of the implementation, but will focus on points of the implementation that did not necessarily went as expected or are additions on top of the initial design due to problems that occurred later on. Also further information on the quality management will be discussed in later parts of this section.

\subsection{Implementation Details}
Most of the implementation is working as planned and is allowing the worker to go through his workday. The most interesting parts here are currently the connection between the web application and the database connection in the backend. As the database connector and the rest service there are implemented in C\# and the web application is implemented using Java. When order information is to be send to the web application, the database backend is first creating an order model object. This model has been created using the \gls{ef} provided by microsoft that is automatically creating the classes for the model from the given database information. This is creating the classes according to the official microsoft C\# language specifications. \citep{manual:csSpecification} 

The classes are afterwards serialized using the \texttt{JavaScriptSerializer} to \gls{serialize} an order object into the \gls{json} format. The \gls{json} message is then send to the client that asked for the order information. The simple implementation for this can be found in listing \ref{lst:objectSerialization}.

\clearpage

\lstset{language=[Sharp]C}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, caption=C\# Object Serialization, label=lst:objectSerialization]
var serializer = new JavaScriptSerializer();
var order = Connector.GetOrder(value);
HttpContext.Current.Response.ContentType = "text/HTML";
HttpContext.Current.Response.Write(serializer.Serialize(order));
\end{lstlisting}

The client is then implemented in Java in the web application and trying to \gls{deserialize} the \gls{json} received from the backend. In Java the jackson library has been used to create the state of the order object from the received message. \citep{website:jackson} The first problem here is that the \gls{json} that is expected from jackson is different, than the \texttt{JavaScriptSerializer} is creating, therefore some transforming needs to be done to the \gls{json}, otherwise the objects state can not be reproduced. The class and variable names that jackson expects need to be in camel case, otherwise it does not accepts them, therefore a method needs to be created that is automatically transforming those to camel case. The received \gls{json} format can be seen in listing \ref{lst:jsonReceived} and the expected format can be seen in listing \ref{lst:jsonExpected}. The message display in these listings have been simplified and are just there to show the different formats.

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, caption=Received JSON format, label=lst:jsonReceived]
{
	"Customer" : {
		"CustomerNumber" : 1	
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, caption=Expected JSON format, label=lst:jsonExpected]
{
	"customer" : {
		"customerNumber" : 1	
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

The method used to transform the \gls{json} message is quite simple and could be improved in the future to increase performance, but for the testing purposes it is enough. The code can be seen in listing \ref{lst:jsonCamelCase}. For further information about what the method does the included javadoc can be read.

\lstset{language=Java}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single, caption=Java Code to Transform JSON, label=lst:jsonCamelCase]
    /**
     * This method is taking the input string and is converting the beginning of
     * every string inside of the json into a lower case letter. This 
     * effectively is transforming every attribute and object into camel case.
     * What this also does is making every string attribute, that is representing
     * the state of an object, start with a lower case letter, which might not
     * be wanted by the user.
     * @param input The initial json string that should be transformed.
     * @return Returns the input json with every attribute in camel case.
     */
    public String jsonToCamelCase(String input) {
        StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder(input);
        for (int i = 0; i < (input.length() - 1); i++) {
            char c = input.charAt(i);
            if (c == '"') {
                char nextChar = input.charAt(i + 1);
                if (nextChar >= 65 && nextChar <= 90) {
                    stringBuilder.setCharAt(i + 1, (char) (nextChar + 32));
                }
            }
        }
        return stringBuilder.toString();
    }
\end{lstlisting}

A few further things need to be changed in the json format, but that can be seen in listing \ref{lst:receiveOrder}. The code here could also be improved a lot especially in regards to modifiability, but it is sufficient for a simple test case that should be created here.

For other cases it is just executing the commands exposed by the rest interface, that is detailed in section \ref{sec:design}. The other implementation details needed are mostly simple web pages and \gls{setter}s and \gls{getter}s which do not need further explanation. The most interesting other design choice that was made for the model in the web application part was to implement a huge class \texttt{order} that is containing multiple inner classes for each of the components. This can be seen in figure \ref{fig:modelInnerClasses}. This has been done since the jackson library is only available to deserialize an object if all of the nested classes are inner classes of the wrapping class.

	\caption{Class Diagram Web App Model Package}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Quality Management}
The quality management aspects have been described in section \ref{sec:qualityManagement} and following this it will be explained how the different aspects have been looked at during the implementation.

\subsubsection{Code Coverage}
The code coverage percentage that has been aimed for during the project has been around 80\% to 90\%. The problem with code coverage is, that for java the coverage plugin is creating an error that could not be resolved during the time of the project. But every method is being called multiple times during the tests and therefore the coverage should be relatively high. 
\subsubsection{Language Conventions}
The language conventions have been checked at their respective sources, in this case Microsoft for C\# \citep{manual:csSpecification}, and Oracle for Java \citep{manual:javaSpecification}. Furthermore they have been followed in all parts of the application.
\subsubsection{Documentation}
The documentation for methods can already be seen in the listings \ref{lst:jsonCamelCase} and \ref{lst:receiveOrder}, furthermore the documentation has been created in similar fashion for all methods. 
\subsubsection{Performance Testing}
Since the web application has already been created to reduce the load on the wearable there will most likely not be any problems of the performance of the wearables. Therefore this aspect of the quality management has not been conducted, as already explained in the description in section \ref{sec:qualityManagement}. Performance testing would have only been done if an issue would be likely or there would be some problems existing in regards to performance, but none of that has revealed itself during the implementation phase.
